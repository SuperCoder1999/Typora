I think you haven't seen the movie, actually I haven't either. I just watched some video introduction. But in just a few minutes, I brought myself into it.

Maybe  you have watched it, and you don't think it's a good movie.But a lot of people like me think this movie is good.

The movie "nihao,lihuanying" can impress almost everyone because everyone has a mother. But not everyone has a sister or a brother.

No matter what , I hope you care about this part of society. Maybe you 、your mother or someone you have a relationship with is one of them.

My family is very similar to the one in the movie. In my hometown, boys were preferred over girls, even in the countryside now. I have a elder sister, who is 8 years older than me. In the years when I was born, family planning(计划生育) was very strict. My parents wanted a boy, so they gave birth to me. But they were fined 20,000 yuan in 1999. You may think that having children is a personal right, but I want to tell you that many plots in Mo Yan's novel *frog* are real.

In this context, my sister and the heroine have a similar fate, but she is not so miserable.

Today, I want to tell you from a younger brother's point of view that whether such a family only destroy the elder sister.

Because in my hometown , elders think that a married woman belongs to someone else's family. So since I was a child, I have been given great hope by my family. My parents can indulged my sister in study. But once the teacher told my parents that I was going backward, they would ask the teacher to make up for my lessons and i was often taught to study hard, so when I was in primary school, I felt that school was for my parents. They puts a lot of pressure on me.

In junior high school, my mother often went to other places. At that time, my sister had finished high school, dropped out of school and started to work. I had to be taken care of by my sister. My sister certainly wasn't willing to take care of me. She often quarreled with my parents in front of me. So I must be very guilty. Until now, I seldom ask for help,because I'm afraid that I owe too much to others.

The younger brother in the movie is very naughty and annoying. The memory in my mind seems to tell me that I was just as annoying as him in my childhood. I'm afraid of that , because in this way,   I owed more to my sister.

Fortunately, now we have our own lives, we will never disturb anyone again.

During the epidemic last year, I lived with my parents from morning till night for three months, which was the longest time since I was 12 years old. But my parents and I often quarreled because I thought they have caused too much shadow to my childhood. These shadows may take a lifetime to fill.

From my point of view, I don't think it's the younger brother who is the culprit. This is just a social problem that should be solved.

Sometimes we should also sympathize with the younger brother.

We can't criticize the thoughts of the past with a modern view. No one should be blamed, and everyone should change their perception.
