Hello! I haven't see any new faces,so i don't need to introduce myself.

Today,i am going to be talking about the influence of Genetically modified Soya on the Birth-Weight and Survival of Rat Pups.

In fact, before last English class, I didn't know what was wrong with transgenic technology. Once there was an advertisement on TV: non genetically modified soybean oil. I don't know why they emphasize this non transgenic.

And I think everyone has fantasized about being a superpower. When I saw spider man for the first time, I fantasized more than once that I had the ability to get bitten by an animal. When I was in high school, I studied genetic engineering. I thought I saw some hope that we could transform human genes to realize my childhood dream.

Another Marvel movie Iron Man 3 reminds us that we have created our own demons. Now it seems that I was naive at that time.

Today I want to talk about why transgenic technology can't help us become superheroes and possibly create demons?

In order to explore this problem, we studied the effect of transgenic soybean on the birth rate and survival status of offspring of rats. There were three groups of experimental subjects, one group of rats was fed with transgenic soybean, the second group was fed with traditional soybean. The third group did not eat soy. The data showed that the mortality rate of offspring of rats fed with transgenic soybean was very high. These results suggest that transgenic soybean may have negative effects on the offspring of rats.

First of all ,At present, scientists all over the world have discussed the four main sources of risk of genetically modified organisms, and the harm of genetically modified organisms to animals and the environment has been revealed. However, there is a lack of literature on the effects of transgenic plants in different generations of organisms, which I think is very worthy of study.

Next, i'd like to talk about the methods we used in our research -- Control variable method. Except that the food composition of each group was different, the rest were the same.

Let's move on and discuss experimental resultã€‚It can be seen from the table that the infant mortality of the three groups is the highest, more than 50% in the transgenic group. It can be seen from table 2 that the death of young mice in the transgenic group occurred at each stage. It can be seen from table 3 that among the three groups, the weight of the transgenic group is the smallest.

So, you have heard what i have to say. What conclusions can you take away from this? Obviously, transgenic soybean has negative effect on newborn mice.

However, we still need to conduct a complex study on the principle of this effect. Our data led us to speculate that the negative effects of transgenic soybean on newborn mice may be caused by two possible factors. One is the result of the insertion of foreign genes or the entry of foreign genes into embryonic cells. The other is caused by the accumulated residues in transgenic soybean residues. No death was observed in the female mice and the surviving young mice. So the inference is probably caused by the first factor of the first reason.
