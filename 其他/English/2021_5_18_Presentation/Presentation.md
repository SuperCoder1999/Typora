其实我在上节英语课之前，都不知道转基因技术有啥不好的。以前电视中有个广告：非转基因大豆油。我都不知道为什么强调这个非转基因。

我想每个人都幻想过自己称为某个超能力者。当我第一次看《蜘蛛侠》，我就在日后不止一次幻想过被某个动物咬过之后就拥有了它的能力。高中的时候学过基因工程，以为看到了些希望，可以把人类的基因通过改造来实现儿时的梦想。

而在另一部漫威电影《钢铁侠》中又提醒到：我们创造了自己的恶魔。现在看来自己好天真。

今天我想讨论一下转基因技术为什么不能帮我们编程超级英雄，并且很可能创造恶魔？

为了，真实探究这个问题，

目前，全世界的科学家讨论了转基因生物风险的4个主要来源。并且转基因生物对动物和环境的危害已经被揭示，而转基因植物在几代不同生物中的影响是非常重要的。

Hello! I haven't see any new faces,so i well not introduce myself.

Today,i am going to be talking about the influence of Genetically modified Soya on the Birth-Weight and Survival of Rat Pups.

In fact, before last English class, I didn't know what was wrong with transgenic technology. Once there was an advertisement on TV: non genetically modified soybean oil. I don't know why they emphasize this non transgenic.

And I think everyone has fantasized about being a superpower. When I saw spider man for the first time, I fantasized more than once that I had the ability to get bitten by an animal. When I was in high school, I studied genetic engineering. I thought I saw some hope that we could transform human genes to realize my childhood dream.

Another Marvel movie Iron Man 3 reminds us that we have created our own demons. Now it seems that I was naive at that time.

Today I want to talk about why transgenic technology can't help us become superheroes and possibly create demons?

为了探究这个问题，我们进行了转基因大豆对大白鼠后代出生率和生存状况的影响的研究。共三组实验实验对象，一组大白鼠被喂食转基因大豆，第二组，吃的传统大豆。第三组没有吃大豆。数据表明吃了转基因大豆的大白鼠的幼崽死亡率很高。这些实验说明，转基因大豆对大白鼠后代可能有消极影响。

In order to explore this problem, we studied the effect of transgenic soybean on the birth rate and survival status of offspring of rats. There were three groups of experimental subjects, one group of rats was fed with transgenic soybean, the second group was fed with traditional soybean. The third group did not eat soy. The data showed that the mortality rate of offspring of rats fed with transgenic soybean was very high. These results suggest that transgenic soybean may have negative effects on the offspring of rats.

## 指向性的语言

First of all , 目前，全世界的科学家讨论了转基因生物风险的4个主要来源，并且转基因生物对动物和环境的危害已经被揭示。但是转基因植物在几代不同生物中的影响却缺乏文献，我认为那是很值得研究的。At present, scientists all over the world have discussed the four main sources of risk of genetically modified organisms, and the harm of genetically modified organisms to animals and the environment has been revealed. However, there is a lack of literature on the effects of transgenic plants in different generations of organisms, which I think is very worthy of study.

Next, i'd like to talk about the methods we used in our research -- Control variable method. Except that the food composition of each group was different, the rest were the same.

Let's move on and discuss experimental result。可以从表中看到三个组的幼鼠死亡率，其中转基因组最高，超过50%。从表二可以看到，转基因组的幼鼠死亡在每个阶段都有。并且从表三可以看到，三个组中，转基因组的幼鼠体重最小。It can be seen from the table that the infant mortality of the three groups is the highest, more than 50% in the transgenic group. It can be seen from table 2 that the death of young mice in the transgenic group occurred at each stage. It can be seen from table 3 that among the three groups, the weight of the transgenic group is the smallest.

So, you have heard what i have to say. What conclusions can you take away from this? 显然转基因大豆对是有新生小鼠的消极影响的。Obviously, transgenic soybean has negative effect on newborn mice.

然而，我们还需要对这种影响的原理进行复杂的研究。我们的数据让我们猜测并认定转基因大豆对新生小鼠的消极影响可能是由两种可能因素引起的。一种是外来基因嵌入或者外来基因进入胚胎细胞的结果。另一种是被转基因大豆残留物中的累计残留引起的。从母老鼠和存活幼鼠中没有观察到死亡现象。所以推断很可能是第一个原因的第一个因素引起的。However, we still need to conduct a complex study on the principle of this effect. Our data led us to speculate that the negative effects of transgenic soybean on newborn mice may be caused by two possible factors. One is the result of the insertion of foreign genes or the entry of foreign genes into embryonic cells. The other is caused by the accumulated residues in transgenic soybean residues. No death was observed in the female mice and the surviving young mice. So the inference is probably caused by the first factor of the first reason.
